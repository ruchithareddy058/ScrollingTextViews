        A single incident sums up my relationship with my <b><i>Dad</i></b>.
        He wanted me to join the IIT and become an engineer.
        I wanted to be a writer, a profession he disdained as having no future.
        Headstrong, in 1969, I stepped out of the train in which my family was relocating from Delhi to Bombay just as the whistle blew.
        I was bent on living my life my way.
        My father, deeply upset, cut me off without a paisa, saying I could jolly well support myself if I was so confident about writing. And so I did, earning enough through writing for the evening papers to pay my rent, college fees and food.
        Six months later, my father, passing through Delhi in December, visited me to check how his strong-headed son was doing, and saw for himself that I was surviving well enough without borrowing or begging.
        He visibly swelled with pride.
        He hugged me, in one action forgiving me but also forgiving himself.
        He used the 400 rupees he had received as a Christmas bonus to buy me utensils, a mattress, and other basics.
        From that day, he would proudly say, “My daughter followed his heart rather than my head — and see what a fine job he has done.”
